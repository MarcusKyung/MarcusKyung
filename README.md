# Welcome!  ðŸ‘‹

## About Me:
After graduating from the University of San Diego in 2017 and working in the marketing field for the past several years I am excited to transition to a hands on role in software. 

My passion for real-world problem solving and technology led me to enroll in and complete a program through Portland, OR-based Epicodus in early 2023. Over the course of this 27-week immersive full stack bootcamp program I learned to use various programming languages and fundamental technologies including JavaScript, C#/.NET, React, HTML5, CSS/Bootstrap, Git/GitHub, Firebase, MySQL, and many others. I am currently seeking full time junior developer roles and look forward to bringing not only my technical skills but also my background and experience as a project manager and organizational leader to my future team/organization. 

When I am not programming/debugging I enjoy exploring Portland/the PNW, reading, watching Formula 1, and playing board games with friends and family.
