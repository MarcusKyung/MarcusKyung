## About Me:
After graduating from the University of San Diego in 2017 and working in the marketing field for the past several years I am excited to be making a career shift to the programming/tech field. My passion for user-centric problem solving and technology led me to take the leap and enroll in the Epicodus full-stack development bootcamp with an anticipated graduation date of September 2023. Over the course of this immerseive program I will learn and practice various programming languages and frameworks including JavaScript, C#, React, HTML, CSS, and more. Upon graduating I hope to apply my new skills in a developer role and look forward to bringing my background as a former project manager to my future team/organization.
